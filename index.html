      <h1>-: Arrays: Removing, inserting, and extracting elements :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        Use the shift method to remove an element from the beginning of an
        array. <br />
        Suppose you have an array, pets, whose elements are "dog", "cat", and
        "bird". The <br />
        following removes the first element, "dog", leaving you with a
        two-element array. <br />
        pets.shift(); <br />
        To add one or more elements to the beginning of an array, use the
        unshift method. <br />
        The following code adds two elements to the beginning of the array.
        <br />
        pets.unshift("fish", "ferret"); <br />
        Use the splice method to insert one or more elements anywhere in an
        array, while <br />
        optionally removing one or more elements that come after it. Suppose you
        have an array with <br />
        <br />
        the elements "dog", "cat", "fly", "bug", "ox". The following code adds
        "pig", "duck", and "emu" <br />
        after "cat" while removing "fly" and "bug". <br />
        pets.splice(2, 2, "pig", "duck", "emu"); <br />
        The first digit inside the parentheses is the index of the position
        where you want to start <br />
        adding if you're adding and deleting if you're deleting. The second
        digit is the number of <br />
        existing elements to remove, starting with the first element that comes
        after the element(s) that <br />
        you're splicing in. The code above leaves you with an array consisting
        of "dog", "cat", "pig", <br />
        "duck", "emu", and "ox". <br />
        You could make additions without removing any elements. The following
        code adds <br />
        "pig", "duck", and "emu" without removing any elements. <br />
        pets.splice(2, 0, "pig", "duck", "emu"); <br />
        You can also remove elements without adding any. If you start with the
        elements "dog", <br />
        "cat", "fly", "bug", and "ox", the following code removes two elements
        starting at index 3 <br />
        â€”"bug" and "ox". This leaves "dog", "cat", and "fly". <br />
        pets.splice(2, 2); <br />
        Use the slice method to copy one or more consecutive elements in any
        position and put <br />
        them into a new array. If you start with an array, pets, consisting of
        "dog", "cat", "fly", "bug", <br />
        and "ox", the following code copies "fly" and "bug" to the new array
        noPets and leaves the <br />
        original array, pets, unchanged. <br />
        var noPets = pets.slice(2, 4); <br />
        The first digit inside the parentheses is the index of the first element
        to be copied. The <br />
        second digit is the index of the element after the last element to be
        copied. <br />
        Two things could trip you up here: <br />
        Since the first index number inside the parentheses specifies the first
        element to be <br />
        copied, you might think the second index number specifies the last
        element to be copied. <br />
        In fact, the second number specifies the index number of the element
        after the last element <br />
        to be copied. <br />
        You must assign the sliced elements to an array. It could, of course, be
        the same array <br />
        from which you're doing the slicing. In that case, you'd be reducing the
        original array to <br />
        only the copied elements. <br />

        You know the song "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall"? If you're teaching
        someone the song, <br />
        <br />
        you could give them these instructions: <br />
        1. Sing "99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer." <br />
        2. Sing "Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the
        wall." <br />
        3. Sing "98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer." <br />
        4. Sing "Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the
        wall." <br />
        5. Sing "97 bottles of beer on the wall, 97 bottles of beer." <br />
        6. Sing "Take one down and pass it around, 96 bottles of beer on the
        wall." <br />
        ...and so on, for 192 more lines of instructions. <br />
        But that isn't how you'd give the instructions, is it? You'd be more
        concise. You'd say <br />
        something like this: <br />
        Sing "99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer. Take one down
        and pass it <br />
        around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall." Repeat this, subtracting 1 each
        time, until there are no <br />
        more bottles of beer on the wall. <br />
        In coding, you run into the bottles-of-beer situation quite often. For
        example, suppose <br />
        you've offered to check if the user's city is one of the 5 cleanest in
        the U.S. The user has <br />
        entered her city, and you've assigned her city to the variable
        cityToCheck. <br />
        You've already assigned the list of the 5 cleanest cities to the array
        cleanestCities. <br />
        var cleanestCities = ["Cheyenne", "Santa Fe", "Tucson", "Great Falls",
        "Honolulu"]; <br />
        Now you go through the array to see if there's a match with the user's
        city. If there is, you <br />
        display an alert telling the user her city is one of the cleanest. If
        there's no match, you display <br />
        an alert telling the user her city isn't on the list. <br />
        1 if (cityToCheck === cleanestCities[0]) { <br />
        2 alert("It's one of the cleanest cities"); <br />
        3 } <br />
        4 else if (cityToCheck === cleanestCities[1]) { <br />
        5 alert("It's one of the cleanest cities"); <br />
        6 } <br />
        7 else if (cityToCheck === cleanestCities[2]) { <br />
        8 alert("It's one of the cleanest cities"); <br />
        9 } <br />
        10 else if (cityToCheck === cleanestCities[3]) { <br />
        11 alert("It's one of the cleanest cities"); <br />
        12 } <br />
        13 else if (cityToCheck === cleanestCities[4]) { <br />
        14 alert("It's one of the cleanest cities"); <br />
        15 } <br />
        60 <br />
        16 else { <br />
        17 alert("It's not on the list"); <br />
        18 } <br />
        Conveniently, JavaScript provides a more concise coding approach. Here's
        a for loop <br />
        that accomplishes most of what the verbose code in the example above
        accomplishes. <br />
        1 for (var i = 0; i <= 4; i++) { <br />
        2 if (cityToCheck === cleanestCities[i]) { <br />
        3 alert("It's one of the cleanest cities"); <br />
        4 } <br />
        5 } <br />
        Let me break down the first line for you. <br />
        The first line begins with the keyword for. <br />
        The three specifications that define the loop are inside the
        parentheses. <br />
        1. A variable that counts iterations and also serves as the changing
        array index is declared <br />
        and set to a starting value, in this case 0. <br />
        2. The limit on the loop is defined. In this case, the loop is to keep
        running as long as the <br />
        counter doesn't exceed 4. Since the counter, in this case, is starting
        at 0, the loop will run <br />
        5 times. <br />
        3. What happens to the counter at the end of every loop. In this case,
        the counter is <br />
        incremented each time. <br />
        The three specifications inside the parentheses are always in the same
        order: <br />
        1. What to call the counter (usually i) and what number to start it at
        (typically 0) <br />
        2. How many loops to run (in this case, the number of elements in the
        array) <br />
        3. How to change the counter after each iteration (typically to add 1
        each time through) <br />
        Things to keep in mind: <br />
        In the example, the counter, i, serves two purposes. It keeps track of
        the number of <br />
        iterations so looping can halt at the right point. And it serves as the
        index number of the <br />
        array, allowing the code to progress through all the elements of the
        array as the counter <br />
        increments with each iteration. <br />
        There is nothing sacred about using i as the counter. You can use any
        legal variable <br />
        name. But coders usually use i because it keeps the first line compact,
        and because <br />
        coders understand that i stands for "iteration." <br />
        In the example, the initial count is 0, the index number of the first
        element of the array.But <br />
        it could be any number, depending on your needs. <br />
        In the example, the counter increments with each iteration. But,
        depending on your needs, <br />
        you can decrement it, increase it by 2, or change it in some other way
        each time through. <br />
        In the example, I specify that the loop is to run as long as i <= 4.
        Alternatively, I could <br />
        have specified i < 5. Either way, since the counter starts at 0, the
        loop runs 5 times. <br />

      <h1>
        -: for loops: Flags, Booleans, array length, and loopus interruptus :-
      </h1>
      <p class="ali">
        There are several problems with the for loop example I gave you in the
        last chapter. The <br />
        first problem is a potential communication problem. If a match between
        the user's city and the <br />
        list of cleanest cities is found, a confirming alert displays. But if
        there is no match, nothing <br />
        happens. The user is left in the dark. If no match is found, we need to
        display an alert saying <br />
        so. But how do we do that? <br />
        We do it with a flag. A flag is just a variable that starts out with a
        default value that you <br />
        give it, and then is switched to a different value under certain
        conditions. In our example, let's <br />
        say this is the flag. <br />
        var matchFound = "no"; <br />
        If a match is found, the value of the flag is changed. At the end, if
        the flag hasn't been <br />
        changedâ€”if it still has the original value of "no"â€”it means no match was
        found, and so we <br />
        display an alert saying the city isn't on the list. <br />
        1 var matchFound = "no"; <br />
        2 for (var i = 0; i <= 4; i++); <br />
        3 if (cityToCheck === cleanestCities[i]) { <br />
        4 matchFound = "yes"; <br />
        5 alert("It's one of the cleanest cities"); <br />
        6 } <br />
        7 } <br />
        8 if (matchFound === "no") { <br />
        9 alert("It's not on the list"); <br />
        10 } <br />
        This works, but rather than assigning the strings "no" and "yes" to the
        switch, it's <br />
        conventional to use the Boolean values false and true. <br />
        1 var matchFound = false; <br />
        2 for (var i = 0; i <= 4; i++); <br />
        3 if (cityToCheck === cleanestCities[i]) { <br />
        4 matchFound = true; <br />
        5 alert("It's one of the cleanest cities"); <br />
        6 } <br />
        7 } <br />
        8 if (matchFound === false) { <br />
        9 alert("It's not on the list"); <br />
        10 } <br />
        There are only two Booleans, true and false. Note that they aren't
        enclosed in quotes. <br />
        The next problem with our example is that it potentially wastes
        computing cycles. <br />
        Suppose on the second loop a match is found and the alert displays. The
        way the loop is <br />
        coded, the loop goes on looping all the way to the end. This is
        unnecessary, since we got our <br />
        answer in the second loop. The problem is solved with the keyword break.
        <br />
        1 var matchFound = false; <br />
        2 for (var i = 0; i <= 4; i++); <br />
        3 if (cityToCheck === cleanestCities[i]) { <br />
        4 matchFound = true; <br />
        5 alert("It's one of the cleanest cities"); <br />
        6 break; <br />
        7 } <br />
        8 } <br />
        9 if (matchFound === false) { <br />
        10 alert("It's not on the list"); <br />
        11 } <br />
        The last problem: In the example, I assume that the number of elements
        in the array is <br />
        known. But what if it isn't? JavaScript has a way of finding out. The
        following code assigns the <br />
        number of elements in the array cleanestCities to the variable
        numElements. <br />
        var numElements = cleanestCities.length; <br />
        Now we can limit the number of loops to the count that JavaScript comes
        up with. <br />
        1 var numElements = cleanestCities.length; <br />
        2 var matchFound = false; <br />
        3 for (var i = 0; i < numElements; i++); <br />
        4 if (cityToCheck === cleanestCities[i]) { <br />
        5 matchFound = true; <br />
        6 alert("It's one of the cleanest cities"); <br />
        7 break; <br />
        8 } <br />
        9 } <br />
        10 if (matchFound === false) { <br />
        11 alert("It's not on the list"); <br />
        12 } <br />
        Now the loop keeps going as long as i is less than the number of
        elements. (Since the <br />
        length number is 1-based and the i number is 0-based, we need to stop 1
        short of the length.) <br />

      <p class="ali">
        Atlantic Records has hired you and me to generate a list of names for
        future rap stars. To <br />
        make things easy, we'll start by making separate lists of some first
        names and last names. <br />
        By combining each of the first names with each of the last names, we can
        generate 20 <br />
        different full names for rappers. <br />
        Starting with "BlueRay," we go through the list of last names,
        generating... <br />
        BlueRay Zzz <br />
        BlueRay Burp <br />
        BlueRay Dogbone <br />
        BlueRay Droop <br />
        We move to the next first name, "Upchuck." Again, we go through the list
        of last names, <br />
        generating... <br />
        Upchuck Zzz <br />
        Upchuck Burp <br />
        Upchuck Dogbone <br />
        Upchuck Droop <br />
        And so on, combining each first name with each last name. <br />
        But look, why not have JavaScript do the repetitive work? We'll use
        nested for <br />
        statements. <br />
        1 var firstNames = ["BlueRay ", "Upchuck ", "Lojack ", "Gizmo ", "Do-Rag
        "]; <br />
        2 var lastNames = ["Zzz", "Burp", "Dogbone", "Droop"]; <br />
        3 var fullNames = []; <br />
        5 for (var i = 0; i < firstNames.length; i++) { <br />
        6 for (var j = 0; j < lastNames.length; j++) { <br />
        7 fullNames.push(firstNames[i] + lastNames[j]); <br />
        67 <br />
        9 } <br />
        10 } <br />
        Things to think about: <br />
        The inner loop runs a complete cycle of iterations on each iteration of
        the outer loop. If <br />
        the outer loop counter is i and the inner loop counter is j, j will loop
        through 0, 1, 2, and <br />
        all the way to the end while i is on 0. Then i will increment to 1, and
        j will loop through <br />
        all of its values again. The outer loop is the minute hand of a clock.
        The inner loop is the <br />
        second hand. <br />
        You can have as many levels of nesting as you like. <br />
        A nested loop is indented 2 spaces beyond its outer loop. <br />
